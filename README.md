# TextSummarizer
There are two fundamental approaches to text summarization: __extractive__ and __abstractive__. 
The former extracts words and word phrases from the original text to create a summary. The latter learns an internal language representation to generate more human-like summaries, paraphrasing the intent of the original text. 

A simple text summarizer that makes use of the frequencies of words in document and creates a summary using the sentences having the most frequent words.
